R code for pathway analysis of phosphoproteomics
The code determines active pathways from receptors to transcription factors in phosphoproteomics data. 
The input files are: 
  network (simple interaction format (sif)), data (3 columns: ProteinNameChar, log2ratioProteinDouble, log2ratioSTYDouble), list of transcription factors, list of receptors)
The output files:
  tab-delimited pathways and scores
